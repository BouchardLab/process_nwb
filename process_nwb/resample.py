    """Resample an array. Operates along the first dimension of the array. This is the low-level
    code. Users shoud likely use `resample()` rather than this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray, (n_time, ...)
        Signal to resample.
    num : int
        Number of samples in resampled signal.
    npad : int
        Padding to add to beginning and end of timeseries. Default 0.
    pad : str
        Type of padding. The default is ``'reflect_limited'``.
    real : bool
        Whether rfft should be used for resampling or fft.
    precision : str
        Either `single` for float32/complex64 or `double` for float/complex.

    Returns
    -------
    y : array
        The x array resampled.

    Notes
    -----
    This uses edge padding to improve scipy.signal.resample's resampling method,
