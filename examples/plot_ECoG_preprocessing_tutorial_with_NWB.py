ECoG Preprocessing Tutorial with NWB
====================================

This tutorial highlights how to preprocess ECoG data which is already stored
in a NWB. It will not focus on the low-level preprocessing functions.

Overview of preprocessing steps
-------------------------------
- Resampling
- Re-referencing and notch filtering
- Time-frequency power calculation
- Normalizing power for each frequency

# Create and store synthetic neural data
# --------------------------------------
# We will create synthetic neural data by convolving white noise with a boxcar,
# adding power in the high gamma range with modulating amplitude, and adding
# common line noise (60Hz) with different weights to each channel. We'll store
# the raw data in an NWB file and run the preprocessing steps on the file and
# store the preprocessed data.

# Normalizing power by zscoring
# ------------------------------
# For neural data, power falls off with frequency so it can be difficult to
# compare amplitude changes across different frequency bands. Furthermore,
# different electrodes may have different contact with the neural surface, which
# can lead to meaningless differences in signal amplitude across channels. To
# address this issue, we normalize each frequency band and electrode by zscoring.
# In this case, the mean and standard deviation are calculated over the first
# 0.25 seconds of the signal, our synthetic baseline time. Different experimental
# recordings and tasks may use different baseline periods.
#
# Then, we will average over the zscored high gamma subbands to form the final
# high gamma signal the plot the zscored ampliced for all channels.
