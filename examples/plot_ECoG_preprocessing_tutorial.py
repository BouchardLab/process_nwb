ECoG Preprocessing Tutorial
===========================

This tutorial will go through the common signal processing steps used to
preprocess ECoG data from raw voltages to zscored high gamma amplitudes. It will
operate on a Numpy array of data rather than use data in an NWB file. All of
the steps in this tutorial are typically independent of the experimental
task structure.

Overview of preprocessing steps
-------------------------------
- Resampling
- Notch filtering
- Re-referencing
- Time-frequency power calculation
- Normalizing power for each frequency

# Create synthetic neural data
# ----------------------------
# We will create synthetic neural data by convolving white noise with a boxcar,
# adding power in the high gamma range with modulating amplitude, and adding
# common line noise (60Hz) with different weights to each channel.

# Resampling the data
# -------------------
# Often times, the raw data (voltages) are recorded at a much higher sampling
# rate than is needed for a particular analysis. Here, the raw data is sampled
# at 10,000 Hz but the high gamma range only goes up to 150 Hz. Resampling the
# will make many downstream computations much faster.

# Re-referencing with common average referencing
# ----------------------------------------------
# There is often common noise from neural recording such as movement artifacts
# or 60 Hz line noise. Additionally, it is often desirable for ECoG channels to
# be referenced to a common ground. Here, we use a robust estimate of the mean
# across all channels (for each timepoint). This quantity is then subtracted all
# channels. By default, this CAR function takes the mean over the center 95% of
# the electrodes.

# %%
#  Time-frequency decomposition with wavelets
# -------------------------------------------
# Here we decompose the neural time series into 6 different frequency subbands
# in the high gamma range using a wavelet transform. The wavelet transform
# amplitude is complex valued and here we take the absolute value.
#
# Note how the bands with center frequency nearest 100 Hz have larger amplitude.

# %%
# Normalizing power by zscoring
# ------------------------------
# For neural data, power falls off with frequency so it can be difficult to
# compare amplitude changes across different frequency bands. Furthermore,
# different electrodes may have different contact with the neural surface, which
# can lead to meaningless differences in signal amplitude across channels. To
# address this issue, we normalize each frequency band and electrode by zscoring.
# In this case, the mean and standard deviation are calculated over the first
# 0.25 seconds of the signal, our synthetic baseline time. Different experimental
# recordings and tasks may use different baseline periods.
#
# Then, we will average over the zscored high gamma subbands to form the final
# high gamma signal the plot the zscored ampliced for all channels.
